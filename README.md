# Description of the game
this code uses the 'w' and 's' keys to move player 1 (the paddle on the left) up and down
it also uses the up and down arrows to move player 2 (the paddle on the left) up and down
the object of the game is to stop the opposing player from getting the puck off the side of the screen your paddle is protecting
then to score by getting it off the opposing players side
to do this you can reflect the puck by placing your paddle infront of the puck
you may also change the movement of the puck up or down by having your paddle hit it whilst moving

# improvements
-fix the collisions so the paddles cannot catch the puck when it moves past the front face of the paddle

# Refences to code used
